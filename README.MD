# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This repo contains the project code for the class project in the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course given by John's Hopkins University through Coursera.  The project involves reading some raw data and performing some transformations in order to provide a tidy dataset.

# R script

A single sequential R-script run.analysis.R does the entire job, from reading the zip file to writing the tidy dataset file.

# Code Book

A code book CodeBook.md explains the data, the variables, and the transformations that were done in order to produce the tidy dataset from the raw data.
